### How We Did It
In this project, we evaluated network structures and the information ecosystem of Twitter with a data set of over 100k users from Kaggle.
We conducted community detection and network structural analysis with the Louvain Method, PageRank(PR) algorithm,
and HITS algorithm using NetworkX in Python. Then at the end, we visualized distributions and interactions between communities using Gephi. Performed influence estimation on specific communities based on user behavior and hashtag content analysis
### Abstract
With the increasing use and impact of social media, the network structure of such platforms poses a unique opportunity to study the makeup of the information ecosystem, and how information travels. In this paper, we explore this topic by analyzing a retweet network composed of 105K Twitter users where 5K users are marked as "hateful" or "normal" users by the data provider. We compared these marked users to the network’s remaining set of users, finding compelling differences in terms of their general behavior and the content they post. Using network visualizations and the Louvain method for community detection, we detected possible communities’ structures and quantified the influence that specific communities had on Twitter. Overall, our findings indicate that hateful users are more connected and tend to be more efficient at spreading information. Conservative users, regardless of label, have a relatively looser retweeting connection with each other but still have a high impact on their retweeters, which could indicate that in addition to hateful users, conservative users are very influential and efficient in spreading information.
